### XorUntwist

This is a small library aimed at the automated cryptanalysis of a two-time key cipher.

Common attacks against such cryptosystems use slow, difficult-to-automate methods such as crib-dragging. This library intends to be a replacement of such methods. We aim to provide an efficient, abstract method of retrieving the English plaintexts from an OTP cipher that reuses keystreams. This project is insipired by [this paper](./sources/nlp_two_time_pads.pdf).
