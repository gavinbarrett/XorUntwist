So, I have a few rather random asinine things to say right now. First, I'd like to express the sympathy I have right now for my mother who is in a car with someone she hates (she works with him) and she'll be there for the better part of seven hours. Ugh. I'd HATE to be in her position right now. It'd just mortify me to be in a car with someone I hated, much less someone I even truly liked for seven hours. I'm not exactly a roadtrip kind of gal.   Second, I was at the gas station filling up my tank (which, took forever might I add. Slowest pump ever) when this little other VW bug, the same color as mine, pulled into the spot behind me. I thought it was rather humorous.  And lastly, I was watching the news last night and they got to the the part where they talk about the tril of Scott Peterson. (They always do.) Come on people. Get over it. This is such a publicity stunt it amazes even me. Do you realize how often women are killed by their husbands because they don't want to deal with their wives anymore when they want to be in another relationship? This is just so ridiculous. I'm sorry if it's heartless, but honestly, II don't care about the trial. Stick him in jail. Set him free. I don't give a hoot. Just stop telling me about it.   And that's my little rant for the day. I think three random things should suit well for right now.   I do however have one thing to add that I forgot last night.   I do contest that it is simply abominable to be so vexed for a fortnight.   God, I love our book club. OK, so, I wanted to change the little picture on the side of my page to Laa Laa, the yellow telletubby. So, I go to google and type in, "pictures of telletubbies." And so, I find the picture I want, not even bothering to look at what website it is, then when I go to copy the location on here, it says it's from transexuals.org...    Interesting.     Well, that wont stop me from using a perfectly good picture. However, it does make me wonder why a transexual site that's probably clearly popular, what with having an easy domain name to remember, has a section on telletubbies. I do understand the great debate over Tinky Winky, but really...I don't know. That's a little weird, even for me.    But, anyway, I was looking at some of the pictures and, I realized how long it's been since I watched the show. Look at this place. Who wouldn't want to live there? And, you get more than the nice land, you get the dictator baby face as a sun! Oh yeah! One more thing, Kels burned me the Chicago CD! Instead of having that incessant Six Flags song in my head, I now have the Cell Block Tango in my head!!  And now, the six merry murderesses of the cook county jail in their rendition of the cell block tango   Pop, Six, Squish, Uh uh, Cicero, Lipschitz!  Pop, Six, Squish, Uh uh, Cicero, Lipschitz!  And now the six merry murderesses of the Crookem County Jail in their rendition of "The Cell Block Tago"  Pop, Six, Squish, Uh uh, Cicero, Lipchitz!  He had it coming He had it coming He only had himself to blame If you'd have been there If you'd have seen it  I betcha you would have done the same!  Pop, Six, Squish, Uh uh, Cicero, Lipschitz!  You know how people Have these little habits That get you down. Like Bernie. Bernie like to chew gum. No, not chew. POP. So I came home this one day, And I am really irritated, and Looking for a little sympathy And there's Bernie layin' on the couch, drinkin' a beer and chewin'. No, not chewin'. Poppin'. So, I said to him, I said, "You pop that gum one more time..." and he did. So I took the shotgun off the wall and I fired two warning shots... ...into his head.  He had it coming He had it coming He only had himself to blame If you'd have been there If you'd have heard it I betcha you would Have dome the same!  I met Ezekiel Young from Salt Lake City about two years ago and he told me he was single and we hit it off right away. So, we started living together. He'd go to work, he'd come home, I'd fix him a drink, We'd have dinner. And then I found out, "Single" he told me? Single, my ass. Not only was he married ...oh, no, he had six wives. One of those Mormons, you know? So that night, when he came home, I fixed him his drink as usual. You know, some guys just can't hold their arsenic.  He had it coming He had it coming He took a flower In its prime And then he used it And he abused it It was a murder But not a crime!  Now, I'm standing in the kitchen carvin' up the chicken for dinner, minding my own business, and in storms my husband Wilbur, in a jealous rage. "You been screwin' the milkman," he says. He was crazy and he kept screamin', "you been screwin the milkman." And then he ran into my knife. He ran into my knife ten times!  If you'd have been there If you'd have seen it I betcha you would have done the same!  Mit kersek, en itt? Azt mondjok, hogy a hires lakem lefogta a ferjemet en meg lecsaptam a fejet. De nem igaz, en artatlan vagyok. Nem tudom mert mondja Uncle Sam hogy en tettem. probaltam a rendorsegen megmayarazni de nem ertettek meg...  Yeah, but di you do it?  UH UH, not guilty!  My sister, Veronica and I had this double act and my husband, Charlie, used to travel round with us. Now, for the last number in our act, we did these 20 acrobatic tricks in a row One,two,three,four,five...splits, spread eagles, back flips,flip flops, one right after the other. So this one night before the show we're down at the hotel Cicero, the three of us,boozin', havin' a few laughs and we ran out of ice, so I go out to get some. I come back, open the door, and there's Veronica and Charlie doing Number Seventeen, the spread eagle. Well, I was in such a state of shock, I completely blacked out. I can't remember a thing. It wasn't until later, when I was washing the blood off my hands I even knew they were dead.   They had it coming They had it coming They had it coming They had it coming They had it coming all along They had it coming all along I didn't do it She didn't do it But if I done it But if she done it How could you tell me that I was wrong?  They had it coming They had it coming They had it coming They had it coming They had it coming They took a flower All along In its prime I didn't do it And then they used it But if I'd done it, How could you tell me that I was wrong?   I loved Al Lipschitz more than I can possibly say. He was a real artistic guy... sensitive... a painter. But he was always trying to find himself. He'd go out every night looking for himself and on the way he found Ruth, Gladys, Rosemary and Irving. I guess you can say we broke up because of artistic differences. He saw himself as alive and I saw him dead.  The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum  They had it comin' They had it comin' They had it comin' They had it comin' They had it comin' They had it comin' All along All along 'Cause if they used us 'Cause if they used us And they abused us And they abused us How could you tell us that we were wrong?  He had it coming He had it coming He only had himself to blame. He only had himself to blame. If you'd have been there If you'd have been there If you'd have seen it If you'd have seen it I betcha you would have done the same!  You pop that gum one more time! Single my ass. Ten times! Miert csukott Uncle Same bortonbe. Number seventeen-the spread eagle. Artistic differences.   Pop, Six, Squish, Uh uh, Cicero, Lipschitz! It looks like spring and It feels like sunny weather But it's a cold day in July  Ever since Great America, things have been going downhill the last few days. Thing have just all of a sudden gotten really confusing and complicated. I'm ok with confusing and complicated but, it's just so sudden. I don't know what to do right now. I'm just going to take things day by day and hope for the best.  I've been thinking a lot of my grandma lately. This time two summers ago, I'd be up bringing her something or watching TV with her because she wasn't feeling well or I'd be sleeping on her incredibly comfortable couch...  When I think about her I can remember so much. The smell of her house, the way she'd ALWAYS watch Jeopardy on Saturday afternoons, the way she'd wear those really, really ugly shoes, her beautiful smile and at the same time her innocent, "what, me?" smile, how she'd always call my house on Sunday nights. I'm just really missing her right now. I guess it's an odd time to miss her but, heh, I guess I can't control that.   Things seem to be crashing all around me right now and there's absolutely no one to talk to about it. I miss having a best, best friend like Amanda. I think Chris might have been able to become that, but....we've kind of lost it. There's only one thing on his mind and I can see it in his eyes no matter how hard he tries. It's not his fault either. People grow apart and change. Peter's actually becoming someone I'm starting to confide in. It's taken me long enough. But, now that I'm finally really trusting him and starting to confide in him, he'll be leaving. Figures.   I guess I've just got a lot on my mind right now. A lot's going on in my family life and...I don't even know how to begin talking to anyone about that. Yes, I did say goodbye to my friends an hour ago. And yes, I did say I would go to sleep. And of course, I didn't. Instead, I finished my book and decided to write in this thing. I guess I really don't have anything to talk about so, I'll try to think of some random topic and rant about that for a few paragraphs. So, basically what I'm saying is, I'd strongly advise that you click the x at the top right corner of this thing. Heh, actually, reading my e-mail, someone just sent me one of those survey things. It's also in a friend's xanga. Sweet. I haven't done one since junior high. Now I'm all excited. I'm going to do it.   SECTION 1 [YOU.] +your  name: Catie + your gender: Female + hair colour: Hm...white.  + eye colour: Eh, kinda depends.  + your location: The prairie state. YaY seventh grade prairie unit. I'm just glad I made it through without committing suicide.  + fears: Drowning, bugs, snakes coming up through the pipes and into my toilet. I know it's the weirdest thing ever. I guess being lonely would count in here.  SECTION 2 [ HAVE YOU EVER ] + peed your pants? Probably when I was a little kid.  + cheated on someone? No + fallen off the bed? You can see me? + fallen for a relative? Alr
