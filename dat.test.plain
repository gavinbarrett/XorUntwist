ight, this seems like a rather rediculous question to me. I haven't ever fallen for a relative...except Lauren...hi Lauren! You're hot. Anyway, the answer is no, but even if I had, would I really announce it to the world? + had plastic surgery? Nah, but there's still time. + broke someone`s heart? I don't really know. I've broken up with people before but...I wouldn't call it breaking their heart... I guess I just don't think that highly of myself to think it's possible that I could break someone's heart. + had your heart broken? Not really actually... + had a dream come true? Sure. + done something you regret? Yes, although I generally try not to regret things. It does no good pondering things that have already happened. Things you can't change.  + cheated on a test? Nope. + been raped? ...this seems like a rather crude question.  + broken a body part? Yeah. That was a good summer...

Yeah + believe in Santa Claus? Who doesn't? + ever get off the computer? Lets see how long AIM has been logged on for. 11 days, three hours and 35 minutes. Does that answer your question?

Jeremy maybe... + who is the 'hottest'? Mary Clare! Totally!!! + who is the cutest? All my friends are cute in their own little idiosyncratic ways! + who laughs the most? Hm, I laugh a heck of a lot. But, I guess Kelly kind of laughs a lot. + who have you known the longest? Kels + who have you known the shortest? Hmmm...zach. He's a sweet kid. :) + do you belong to a crew? What is this word crew? I don't understand. This must be like...not Illinois slang. I guess I'll take it to mean a clique and if that's the case...yes. + do you hang out with the opposite sex? Quite a bit actually... + do you trust your friends? Hm. I trust certain friends more than others.  + are you a good friend? I can't really say. That's not for me to judge.  + can you keep a secret? Yes.   SECTION 6 [ THE LAST PERSON YOU...] + hugged - Hm, hm, hm...Chris I think.  + gave EPROPS - EPROPS....? What is all this slang? I DON'T UNDERSTAND!!

I have ideas of what I want but, I don't know yet.  + What was the worst day of your life? - The day my grandma was diagnosed with terminal cancer.  + What is your most embarrassing story? - Well...that pole one is pretty far up there. We were walking downtown Naperville and we walked past this group of guys and they were like, "the girl in the pink is cute" and, I realized I was the only one wearing pink. It surprised me so much I almost walked into a pole and THAT surprised me so much that I almost walked into a second pole.  + What has been the best day of your life? - Hmmm....I really don't know honestly.
